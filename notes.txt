---> API
    It stand for application programming interface, it is a software interface that allows two
    applications to interact with each other without any intervention.
    It is a collection of functions. It is a code that can be accessed or executed.
    -> It helps to different softwares to communicate and exchange data with each other.


    -->Web APIs 
    ->Server side APIs:- JSON or XML
    ->Client side APIs:- extend functionality within a web browser or HTTP client.
        ->examples
            ->Google Map API
            -> Youtube API
    -> API Testing tools
        ->Postman, vRest, ping-api 

    -> Soap and Rest API
        SOAP:- Simple Object Access Protocol
        REST:- Representational State Tranfer

    --> Differences
    -> Soap api has an official standard because it is a Protocol while REST  api
    has no official standard (it is an architectural style).
    -> Soap uses only HTTP and XML while REST uses HTTP, JSON, XML, URL for data communication and Tranfer.

    -> express js we can define routes as a api
    app.METHOD(url, callback)
        -> methods:- get, post, put, delete

    app.get("/api/getdata",(req, res)=>{
        res.status(200).json({'empdata':[]});
    }) 

    async function deletePost(id){
        await postModel.deleteOne({_id:id}, )
    }
    app.delete('/:id',async(req, res)=>{
        await deletePost(req.params.id);
        res.json({'msg': 'deleted'})
    })
